      "Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNESL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), has announced acquisition of 100 percent shareholding of REC Solar Holdings AS\n",
      "Reliance Industries (RIL) share price touched a 52-week high of Rs 2,724.70 adding 2 percent in the early trade on October 11&nbsp;after the company&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;a controlling stake in the REC Solar Holdings.  &amp;quot;Reliance New Energy Solar (RNESL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries&nbsp;(RIL), has announced acquisition of 100 percent shareholding of REC Solar Holdings AS (REC Group) from China National Bluestar (Group), for an Enterprise Value of USD 771 million,&amp;quot; Reliance Industries said in a BSE filing.  In a separate announcement,&nbsp;Reliance New Energy Solar said it will acquire 40 percent of Sterling and Wilson Solar (SWSL) in a deal underscoring the company's clean-energy ambitions.       RNESL will buy a stake in Sterling and Wilson Solar, a leading solar engineering, procurement and constructions solutions provider, through a combination of primary investment, secondary purchase and open offer, RIL said in a statement.  The acquisition of REC will help Reliance with a ready global platform and the opportunity to expand and grow in key green energy markets globally, including in the US, Europe, Australia and elsewhere in Asia, it added.  REC is headquartered in Norway and has its operational headquarters in Singapore and regional hubs in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia-Pacific REC has over 600 utility and design patents, of which 446 are granted and balance are under evaluation.       Also Read - Reliance New Energy Solar acquires REC Solar: 8 key things to know  Reliance will strongly support for REC&rsquo;s planned expansions including 2-3 GW Cells and Module capacity in Singapore, brand new 2 GW Cells and Module unit in France and another 1 GW Modules plant in the US.  In India, Reliance plans to use this industry leading technology in their fully integrated, metallic Silicon to PV Panel manufacturing giga factory at Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex, Jamnagar initially starting with 4 GW per annum capacity and eventually growing to 10 GW per annum.  &ldquo;It is in line with our strategy of investing in new and advanced technologies and operating capabilities aimed at achieving Reliance&rsquo;s goal of enabling 100 GW clean and green energy before the end of this decade,&amp;quot; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries.  Experts remained bullish on Reliance Industries and asked to hold the stock in a portfolio especially after several deals in the green energy space.  &amp;quot;The acquisitions are in line with Reliance's strategy to diversify into Green Energy. Unlike other acquisitions. REC Solar is also a low cost manufacturer of Solar grade Polysilicon and PV Cells. The acquisition of REC Solar Holdings will provide a global platform to Reliance and access to green energy markets,&amp;quot; said Jay Prakash Gupta, Founder at Dhan.  He further said over the last 18 months, Reliance has been agile and has taken bold and swift decisions, and has become a dominant player in Retail and Technology businesses. &amp;quot;Its plan to enter Green Energy is a positive move.&amp;quot;  Reliance is a kind of stock which one should buy and hold in a portfolio as an investor, Gupta advised.  Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research advised buying the stock on every dip near Rs 2,400 as that level will be an opportunity to accumulate stock for the levels of Rs 3,000 in FY22.  &amp;quot;Reliance Industries aims to be carbon free by 2035 and hence emerged out to be one of the major players in this space. RIL&rsquo;s business is well diversified and future outlook looks good. Also, it will be interesting to watch the gross refining margins (GRMs) for its petrochemical business as crude has been rallying and is well settled above $75 a barrel, therefore GRM is expected to be better in Q1FY22,&amp;quot; he said.  However, as the stock has already rallied around 10 percent from Rs 2,500 level, Garg is expecting consolidation in the stock for next few months.  Catch all the market action on our live blog  Jefferies  Research house has maintained buy rating on Reliance Industries and raised the target price to Rs 3,050 from Rs 2,580 per share.  The company has acquired REC group, an integrated solar PV maker, for USD 771 million. REC is the only international company to commercialise tech that consumes 75% less power versus Chinese companies.  REC has patented tech &amp;amp;amp; opens up export market for company&rsquo;s solar business.  We has included company&rsquo;s solar business valuation in our target and there&rsquo;s possibility of 10-12% upgrade to consensus O2C EBITDA in FY22, said Jefferies. Kotak Institutional Equities  Kotak Institutional Equities maintained its Add rating for the stock, but revised upward its estimate of fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;quot;RIL&rsquo;s announced acquisitions and tie-ups in the new energy business put in place the initial building blocks of technology and expertise to set up the four proposed giga factories in the coming years. We retain ADD with a revised Fair Value of Rs2,800 noting near-term triggers from (1) recovery in refining cycle, (2) sustained momentum in subscriber additions post the imminent launch of JioPhone Next, (3) potential hike in telecom tariffs and (4) anticipated strong rebound in retail business.&amp;quot;  RNESL-Sterling Deal  In the first leg of the deal, RNESL will acquire a 15.46 percent stake in Sterling &amp;amp;amp; Wilson Solar at Rs 375 per share, or roughly Rs 1,100 crore.  Also Read -&nbsp;RIL Unit to buy 40% of Sterling and Wilson via preferential allotment, secondary purchase  In the second leg, Shapoorji Pallonji and Khurshed Daruvala, the promoters of Sterling and Wilson, will sell 1.84 crore shares (around 9.7 percent equity) to RNESL at the same price of Rs 375 per share.  This will require the Reliance unit to make an open offer to public shareholders for an additional 25.9 percent stake.  In case, the open offer fails to push RNESL&rsquo;s total stake to 40 percent, Shapoorji Pallonji and Daruvala will sell more of their shares to make good the difference.

      "The Reliance stock has gained 23 percent over the past two months and was one of the top five gainers during this period. It was one of the drivers that helped the BSE Sensex surpass the 60,000 milestone in September\n",
      "Shares of oil retail-to-telecom major Reliance Industries surged to a record high on October 6 after attracting healthy buying interest for about two months. The stock hit a market capitalisation of Rs 17.46 lakh crore following several months of consolidation.  Reliance shares climbed to a fresh high of Rs 2,623 on the BSE from the previous day&rsquo;s close of Rs&nbsp;2,609.10. The stock&nbsp;was trading at Rs 2,576.10, down&nbsp;1.26 percent, at 1417 hours, and its partly paid-up shares fell&nbsp;1.61 percent to Rs 1,930.50.

The Reliance stock has gained 23 percent over the past two months and it was one of the top five gainers during this period, after Bajaj Finserv, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and HCL Technologies. It was also one of the drivers that helped the BSE Sensex surpass the 60,000 milestone and the Nifty 50 to jump near the 18,000 mark in September.  Reliance Industries said October 2 it invested Rs 7.43 crore ($1 million) in cash in 1 million equity shares of $1 each of Reliance International (RINL), a newly incorporated wholly owned subsidiary in Abu Dhabi Global Market, United Arab Emirates.  This company, which is yet to start business operations, will undertake activities related to trading of crude oil, petroleum products, petrochemicals and agricultural commodities, among others, the company said in its BSE filing.  Reliance Jio, the company&rsquo;s telecom unit, and Google said in September that they had made considerable progress towards launching JioPhone Next, a first-of-its-kind device featuring an optimised operating system based on Android and Play Store.  &ldquo;Both companies have begun testing JioPhone Next with a limited set of users for further refinement and are actively working to make it available more widely in time for the Diwali festive season. This additional time will also help mitigate the current industry-wide, global semiconductor shortages,&rdquo; Reliance had said.  In September, subsidiary Reliance Strategic Business Ventures acquired 22.8 million shares of Strand Life Sciences, a genomic testing company, for Rs 393 crore.  &ldquo;A further investment of up to Rs 160 crore is expected to be completed by March 2023. The total investment will translate into around 80.3 percent of equity share capital in Strand on a fully diluted basis,&rdquo; Reliance said on September 3.  Strand, with a turnover of Rs 88.7 crore and profit of Rs 8.48 crore in FY21, is a pioneer of genomic testing in India with bioinformatics software and clinical research solutions to healthcare providers including clinicians, hospitals, medical devices manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies.  &ldquo;This investment is part of the group&rsquo;s digital health initiatives to foster affordable access to world-class technology and innovation-led healthcare ecosystem in India,&rdquo; Reliance said.  Additionally, subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures acquired sole control of Just Dial on September 1, now holding 40.98 percent in the local search engine.

Mukesh Ambani&nbsp;has wealth of Rs 7,18,000 crore, making him the richest man in the country.

      " RIL, Mahindra, Wipro among over 100 firms committed to reporting stakeholder capitalism metrics: World...\n",
      "The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n",
      "More than 100 business houses globally, including Reliance Industries, Mahindra Group and Wipro from India, have committed to including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in their annual or sustainability reports, the World Economic Forum said on Tuesday.  Of these, more than 50 have already begun including Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, an initiative of Geneva-based WEF, in their mainstream financial and regulatory reporting. These include PayPal, PwC, Petronas, S&amp;amp;amp;P, Salesforce, Total and Yara International.  The 'stakeholder capitalism metrics' initiative of the WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, seeks to improve the ways that companies measure and demonstrate their performance against ESG (environmental, social and governance) indicators and to enable positive contributions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The project's twin objectives are to accelerate convergence among the leading private ESG standard-setters and to bring greater comparability and consistency to the reporting of ESG disclosures.  During its ongoing Sustainable Development Impact Summit, the WEF said that the international support is growing for the stakeholding capitalism metrics initiative with more than 50 companies having begun reporting these metrics in their 2020-2021 filings, while over 100 have shown support for this initiative so far.  The summit brings together global leaders from business, government, and civil society under the theme 'Shaping an Equitable, Inclusive and Sustainable Recovery'.  Those having committed to such reporting include Accenture, Allianz, Bank of America, Dell, Deloitte, EY, HEINEKEN, IBM, Mahindra Group, Mastercard, Nasdaq, Nestle, Reliance Industries, UBS, Unilever and Wipro.  Drawn from existing standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics provide a set of metrics that can be reported on by all companies, regardless of industry or region, the WEF said.  The metrics also offer comparability, which is particularly important for informing ongoing efforts to create a systemic, globally accepted set of common standards for reporting on sustainability performance.  &amp;quot;We are delighted to see so many companies joining this effort and, even more so, excited to see many already implementing the metrics into their reporting,&amp;quot; WEF Managing Director Olivier Schwab said.  &amp;quot;This is the first time we have publicly seen this breadth of data from global companies across sectors on ESG factors. The Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are already demonstrating that consistent and comparable ESG reporting can help articulate to stakeholders the collective contribution of ESG commitments,&amp;quot; Schwab added.  An early analysis of reports already incorporating the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in mainstream reporting demonstrates that it is now easier to consistently measure individual company progress against critical ESG areas, as well as the collective impact of those companies committed to reporting the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.  An initial analysis of the first 45 reports from companies shows how companies are building skills for the future, with over USD 1.5 trillion invested in training.  They also indicate that companies are innovating for better products and services, with over USD 20 trillion spent on R&amp;amp;amp;D and USD 23 trillion in cumulative multi-year innovation investments. They are also contributing to their communities and social vitality with nearly USD 140 trillion in taxes.  The WEF said companies have also faced some challenges reporting on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. These include data accessibility, jurisdictional challenges and data-processing capabilities.  Despite these challenges, corporate support for ESG reporting and the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics initiative continues to grow and the Forum will continue to invite all of its partners to join this initiative, it added.

      "The price, referred to as APM or administered rate, will rise to $3.15 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the period from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 from the current $1.79, ICICI Securities said  \n",
      "CNG and piped cooking gas prices in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai may be hiked by 10-11 percent next month as the government-dictated gas price is set to rise by about 76 percent, ICICI Securities said in a report.  The government, using rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations, fixes the price of natural gas produced by firms such as state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) from fields given to them on nomination basis, every six months. The next review is due on October 1.  The price, referred to as APM or administered rate, will rise to $3.15 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the period from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 from the current $1.79, the brokerage said.  The rate for gas from deepwater fields such as KG-D6 of Reliance Industries Ltd and BP Plc would rise to USD 7.4 per mmBtu next month.  Natural gas is the raw material that is converted into compressed natural gas (CNG) for use in automobiles as fuel or piped to household kitchens for cooking purposes.  &amp;quot;The expected surge in APM gas prices would present a challenge to city gas distribution (CGD) players as it would mean a rise in their gas cost for CNG and residential piped natural gas,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;APM gas price rise would mean hefty price hikes would have to be made by IGL (that retails CNG in national capital and adjoining cities) and MGL (which retail CNG in Mumbai) in the next one year.&amp;quot;  The city gas distributors (CGD) &amp;quot;would have to make price hikes of 10-11 percent in October,&amp;quot; ICICI Securities said in a report.  Going by the trend in international markets, the APM gas price is likely to rise to $5.93 per mmBtu in April 2022 to September 2022 and to $7.65 during October 2022 to March 2023.  This would mean another 22-23 percent hike in CNG and piped natural gas prices in April 2022 and 11-12 percent in October 2022, it said.  &amp;quot;Rise in APM gas price from $1.79 per mmBtu in H1FY22 to $7.65 per mmBtu in H2FY23E would mean MGL and IGL would have to make price hikes of 49-53 percent during October 2021 to October 2022,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;CGD players may be able to make the required hefty price hikes given sharply higher prices of competing fuels, petrol and diesel. However, some hit to prevailing lofty margins of MGL and IGL cannot be ruled out.&amp;quot;  The rise in gas price would help boost margins of ONGC and Oil India Ltd as well as private companies such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).

      "RIL shares up 25% this year: What should investors do with the stock?\n",
      "The rally in the stock is not done yet, experts point out as the fundamental outlook of the stock suggests it may go further.\n",
      "Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) seem to be on a record breaking spree as investors lap up the stock believing in its growth story, thanks to the visible progress on the front of Reliance Aramco deal, rapidly increasing digital footprint of Reliance Jio, healthy growth prospects of Reliance Retail and the company's plans regarding the renewable energy business.  On September 6, the stock climbed 4 percent to hit its fresh record high of Rs 2,479.85 on BSE, jumping as much as 25 percnet year-to-date (YTD). Such a strong gain in a heavyweight like Reliance Industries is a huge thing and indicates strong optimism regarding the company's growth prospects, experts point out.  The stock made a fresh peak of September 6 after its subsidiary Reliance Strategic Business Ventures (RSBVL) acquired 2,28,42,654 equity shares of Rs 10 each of Strand Life Sciences for a cash consideration of Rs 393 crore.  Track Live Market Updates Here  A further investment of up to Rs 160 crore is expected to be completed by March 2023, RIL said in a regulatory filing and added that the total investment will translate into 80.3 percent of equity share capital in Strand on a fully diluted basis.  More steam left  The rally in the stock is not done yet, experts point out as the fundamental outlook of the stock suggests it&nbsp;may go further.  &amp;quot;Reliance industries have been soaring on the back of fast progress made in the Saudi Aramco deal. The other reasons that are responsible for soaring price is the increase in Reliance Jio and its digital footprint. The expansion of Reliance industries in solar power business has also positively impacted the prices,&amp;quot;&nbsp;said&nbsp;Ashis Biswas, Head of Technical Research at CapitalVia Global Research.  He expects the price of Reliance industries to go till the level of Rs 2,700-2,750 by the end of the year.  Global financial Firm Morgan Stanley has an 'overweight' view on RIL stock with a target price of Rs 2,269.  &amp;quot;Strand Life's acquisition has added another stack to the digital health ecosystem plans. In the past four years, the company has completed $4 billion in acquisitions,&amp;quot; Morgan Stanley underscored.  Vishal Wagh, Research Head of Bonanza Portfolio is of the view that one can invest in the stock with a stop loss below Rs 2,180 for the target of Rs 2,600-2,720 plus in the next couple of quarters.  &amp;quot;Those who are already holding it can continue to hold it. Even averaging at this level is possible with said stop loss,&amp;quot; said Wagh.  Santosh Meena, who is Head of Research at Swastika Investmart believes the stock of RIL can hit the target of Rs 2,850 soon.  &amp;quot;Reliance Industries shares have witnessed a breakout of 1-year of consolidation. It may lead to a fresh leg of the bull run in this counter after a period of underperformance where Rs 2,500 is an immediate psychological hurdle and Rs 2,850 is an imminent target. On the downside, Rs 2,375-2,275 has become a strong demand zone,&amp;quot; said Meena.  Abhijeet Bora, AVP &ndash; Fundamental Research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas has a buy call on the stock.  He underscored that RIL&rsquo;s earnings outlook is improving with the company's Singapore complex gross refining margin (GRM) in recovery mode.  &amp;quot;Singapore complex August GRM stood at nearly $3.4/bbl due to improving demand, declining petroleum product inventories and refinery outages due to hurricane Ida,&amp;quot; Bora pointed out.  Besides, potential materialisation of a likely minority stake sale in the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business could unlock value of the stock, Bora said.  The growth prospects of company's Jio business is also looking bright.  Bora highlighted that the affordable JioPhone Next (4G enabled smart phone) is slated to be launched on September 10 which would help Jio to gain subscriber market share while likely upgradation of exiting feature phone users to smart phone could aid ARPUs (average revenue per unit).  All these factors make the stock an attractive bet for investment.  Technically, the stock has provided a breakout from the sideways consolidation with a clear buy crossover in its daily momentum indicators.  &amp;quot;The breakout has come after three-quarters of consolidation and with this, it seems that the next 1-2 quarters are likely to be positive for the stock,&amp;quot; said Jay Thakkar, Vice President and Head of Equity Research at Marwadi Shares and Finance Limited.  &amp;quot;The support on the lower side is pegged at Rs 2,250 and the target on the upside is Rs 2,800-Rs 3,000 from hereon, so the risk-to-reward is absolutely in favour of the bulls. Hence, one can buy the stock at the current level as well as on dips with a closing basis stop loss of Rs 2,250,&amp;quot; said Thakkar.  At this juncture, the stock looks set to scale fresh peaks and in the long-run, with occasional profit-booking, the stock is expected to give healthy returns to investors owing to its strong fundamentals and business growth plans.

      "Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani, on September 3, reiterated his commitment to invest Rs 75,000 crore over the next three years in green energy initiatives, including the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar, as the global energy behemoth shifts its focus from hydrocarbons to renewable power.  Addressing the International Climate Summit 2021, Ambani said that work was happening at a brisk pace to develop the 5,000-acre Giga Complex, which would be one of the world's largest green energy facilities, and that RIL was on track to become a net-zero carbon company by 2035.  At the event, which is on developing India's hydrogen energy ecosystem, Ambani said that the Giga Complex would have four giga factories to produce solar integrated photovoltaic units, advanced batteries to store energy, electrolysis to produce green hydrogen and a fuel cell plant to convert that hydrogen to green energy.

Bhupender Yadav ji,&nbsp; Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Power and New &amp;amp;amp; Renewable Energy Shri Raj Kumar Singh ji, Hon&rsquo;ble Minister of Science and Technology Shri Jitendra Singh ji,&nbsp; Member Energy NITI Aayog Dr. V K Saraswat,&nbsp; Former Executive Director International Energy Agency, Mr. Nobuo Tanaka Chairman Greenstat India, Mr. Sturle Pedersen Other distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen,  Good morning to all of you.  It is my privilege to deliver the inaugural address at the International Climate Summit - 2021 before this august audience.  I am delighted to see that this conference is bringing together leading policymakers, industrialists, investors, and scientists to discuss climate change and clean energy.  This Summit is taking place against the backdrop of a historic announcement by our beloved Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji on August 15.  In his address to the nation on the 75th Independence Day, he launched the Green Hydrogen Mission for India.  The fact that he chose &ldquo;Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav&rdquo; to make this announcement has sent a powerful message to both Indians and the rest of the world.  In my view, the message is two-fold:  One, India is determined to achieve azadi from dependence on fossil energy and become atma-nirbhar in New and Renewal Energy.  Two, India will make its fullest contribution to the global effort for achieving the goals and targets of Climate Action.  Dear Friends,  Climate Change is undoubtedly the most daunting challenge facing human civilisation today. The world is witnessing with alarming frequency the disastrous effects of global warming. Glaciers are retreating. Mean sea level is rising.  Extreme and unpredictable weather changes are becoming regular. Ecological damage is becoming stark. Indeed, Climate Change, if uncontrolled, can threaten the very existence of life on our planet. Therefore, it is not enough to make our economies carbon neutral. The world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.  We have only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean and renewable energy. Because Climate Change is a global problem, the clean energy transition calls for the widest possible global cooperation in technology development, investments and fair market access.  Ladies and gentlemen,   While this clean energy transition is a global imperative, it is important for India for another reason. Most of our present energy demand is met by imported fossil fuels costing us 160 billion USD every year.&nbsp; Although India&rsquo;s per capita energy consumption and emissions are less than half the global average, we are the world&rsquo;s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  India&rsquo;s energy needs will increase exponentially as our economic growth accelerates to fulfil the aspirations of 1.38 billion people. How do we increase our energy production while drastically reducing our carbon emission content?  Both India and the world are thus facing an unprecedented challenge. However, every challenge in human history has come with an opportunity to move to the next level of progress.  Dear Friends,  I am convinced that Climate Change is an opportunity for human civilisation to renew itself in the 21st century&hellip; An opportunity to create a healthier, happier, more secure and more resilient future for the human race&hellip;  A future in which there will be greater harmony between Man and Mother Nature. This opportunity for civilizational renewal will be realised by New and Renewable Energy. If Old Energy created the problem of Climate Change, New Energy will provide a reliable solution to Climate Mitigation.  As a matter of fact, a New GREEN REVOLUTION has already begun in India. The Old Green Revolution made India self-reliant in food production. The New Green Revolution will help make India self-sufficient in energy production.  It is a matter of great pride for all of us that India has now achieved a major milestone of 100 gigawatts installed renewable energy. India is today among the top three most attractive destinations for Renewable Energy.  The target of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by December 2022 is now well within sight. &nbsp;The entire world will applaud India&rsquo;s singular achievement under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister.  Dear Friends,  I take this opportunity to share with you my perspectives on how India can become a global leader in Green Energy Revolution in the years to come. The Indian subcontinent is truly blessed by Soorya Deva, Vayu Deva and other gods with abundant renewable energy resources.&nbsp; Taking advantage of over 300 sunny days in a year, India can easily generate over 1,000 GW of solar energy on just 0.5% of our land.  Solar is perfectly suited to decentralised energy production, which in turn can promote decentralised socio-economic development. By investing in smart, two-way grids, micro-grids, efficient storage solutions and smart meters, we can enable individuals, communities and neighbourhoods to become both consumers and producers of energy.  These installations can be located close to demand. They have low maintenance requirements.&nbsp; Importantly, they have little environmental impact and entail zero human displacement problems. The rapid fall in the cost of production has made solar energy highly competitive, attracting large-scale investments.  This shall play a key role in ensuring similar growth trends in &ldquo;Green Hydrogen&rdquo; &ndash; the future replacement of fossil fuels. Green Hydrogen is a zero-carbon energy. It is the best and cleanest source of energy, which can play a fundamental role in the world&rsquo;s decarbonisation plans. Green hydrogen is key to our ever green, sustainable and prosperous future of everyone on the planet  Hydrogen has high gravimetric energy density and can be reconverted into electricity and heat with zero emissions. Although the costs of hydrogen from electrolysis today are high, they are expected to fall significantly in the coming years.  New technologies are emerging for hydrogen storage and transportation, which will dramatically reduce the cost of distribution. Furthermore, the Government of India is planning to create an enabling Green Hydrogen eco-system in the country. Because of all these developments, Green Hydrogen will surely attract significant investments.  Dear Friends,  Reliance Industries is fully committed to realising the vision of our Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister to fuel India&rsquo;s Green Economy using clean energy. Last year I had announced our ambitious commitment to make Reliance a net carbon zero company by 2035.  This year, I presented our strategy and roadmap for the New Energy Business, which will be the next big Value Creation Engine for Reliance and India. We have started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar.  It will be amongst the largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world. This complex will have four Giga Factories, which cover the entire spectrum of renewable energy. The first will be an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. The second will be an advanced energy storage battery factory. &nbsp;The third will be an electrolyser factory for the production of Green Hydrogen.  The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power. Over the next three years we will invest 75,000 crore rupees in these initiatives.&nbsp; Reliance will thus create and offer a fully integrated, end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to India and Indians.  Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji has set the goal to reach 450GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Out of this, Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030.&nbsp; This will create a pan-India network of kilowatt and megawatt scale solar energy producers who can produce Green Hydrogen for local consumption.  This will bring enormous benefits and prosperity to rural India. Efforts are on globally to make Green Hydrogen most affordable fuel option by bringing down its cost to initially under USD 2 per kg.&nbsp; Let me assure you all that Reliance will aggressively pursue this target and achieve it well before the turn of this decade.  And India has always set and achieved even more audacious goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am sure that India can set even more aggressive target of achieving under USD 1 per kg within a decade. This will make India the first country globally to achieve $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade &ndash; the 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen.  India has achieved several goals that seemed impossible over the years. I am sure this 1-1-1 target for Green Hydrogen will also be achieved by our talented young entrepreneurs, researchers and innovators.  Respected Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,  You are the architect of a New India. Your vision of New India is propelled by New and Renewable Energy. It will create millions of new and high-value green jobs for our youth. It will give a big boost to green enterprises in India, who can proudly proclaim: &ldquo;Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!&rdquo;.  It will transform India from a large Importer of Fossil Energy to a large Exporter of Clean Energy solutions. It will also bridge the green energy divide in India and globally. I am certain that, under your dynamic leadership, India will present to the world a template of a Green Economy Movement, which will truly be a People&rsquo;s Movement.  On behalf of all my colleagues in the Indian industry, on behalf of Reliance and on my own behalf, I pledge full support and commitment to your vision and mission.  Thank you.  &nbsp;Disclaimer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group. Network18 is controlled by Independent Media Trust, of which Reliance Industries is the sole beneficiary.\n",

      "Even though the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 will be seen on its retail and refining business sequentially, the June quarter results of Reliance Industries (RIL) may be a healthy one on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, with revenue jumping as much as 80 percent.  The oil-to-telecom conglomerate will announce its Q1FY22 results on July 23.  The company&rsquo;s retail and telecom businesses flourished in FY21, despite COVID-led disruptions, thanks to its aggressive growth philosophy, which mitigated the impact of the pandemic on the overall business and provided the much-needed capital raise and deleveraging.

      "Ajanta Pharma, Alembic Pharma, Astral Poly Tech, AU Small Finance and Bajaj Finance are among the 'potential 25 wealth creators for the next 25 years', the brokerage firm says.\n",
      "Infosys, Reliance Industries (RIL) and Kotak Mahindra Bank have been the fastest, the biggest and the most consistent wealth creator, respectively, between 1995 and 2020 while consumer/retail sector has been the largest wealth-creating sector in the same period, said Motilal Oswal Financial Services in its Motilal Oswal 25th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2020.  Kotak Mahindra Bank has also been the top all-round wealth creator, the brokerage firm said.  The Annual Wealth Creation Study further revealed that Tasty Bite Eatables has been the fastest wealth creator In the last 5 years while Reliance Industries has been the biggest and Pidilite has been the most consistent in the same period.  Besides, Ajanta Pharma, Alembic Pharma, Astral Poly Tech, AU Small Finance and Bajaj Finance are among the 'potential 25 wealth creators for the next 25 years', said the brokerage firm.    The brokerage firm on December 22 announced the Motilal Oswal 25th Annual Wealth Creation Study, 2020.  For the last 25 years, the firm has been releasing a wealth creation study every year. Raamdeo Agrawal, Chairman of Motilal Oswal Group, commissions&nbsp;the study every year.  In this year's study, the brokerage firm attempted to shortlist 25 stocks likely to deliver handsome returns over the next 25 years.  As per the brokerage firm, it made a list of 150 mid-cap companies i.e. companies that are ranked 101 to 250 by current market cap.  It preferred consumer-facing, secular business models and eliminated cyclical businesses like auto ancillaries, capital goods, chemicals, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas and realty which reduced the list of companies from 150 to 114.  To ensure the chosen firms are very profitable, the brokerage firm said it&nbsp;picked companies with last 5-year average RoE greater than 15 percent. This reduced the list from 114 to 63.  Next, it judged the business potential and management potential of the companies, and selected only those which qualified on both counts. This reduced the list from 63 to 28.  After that, the brokerage firm flagged off market leaders from the 28 companies to arrive at a list of 13 companies. Apart from these 13 companies, the brokerage chose 5 such companies from the list of 28 that are beneficiaries of value migration. In situations of value migration, all companies benefit irrespective of market leadership.  Now, the total shortlisted stocks were 18.  The brokerage firm said it chose only large-caps for financials and picked 6 leader names for the portfolio, now taking the total to 24.  At last, it opted for a pure digital play, even if it didn&rsquo;t meet some of the above filters, taking the total to 25.  &amp;quot;We believe in the very long run, valuations matter less. So we ignored the same in the shortlisting process,&amp;quot; said Motilal Oswal.

      "Located at a water depth of greater than 2,000 meters, R Cluster is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia and expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.9 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in 2021.\n",
      "Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and BP on December 18 announced the start of production from the R Cluster, ultra-deep-water gas field in block KG D6 off the east coast of India.  R Cluster, located about 60 km from the existing KG D6 Control &amp;amp;amp; Riser Platform (CRP) off the Kakinada coast, is the first of the three deep-water gas projects in block KG D6 being developed by RIL and BP to come onstream.  The other two projects are: Satellites Cluster and MJ. The three projects together are expected to meet nearly 15 percent of India&rsquo;s gas demand by 2023, the companies said in a joint statement.  Located at a water depth of greater than 2,000 meters, it is the deepest offshore gas field in Asia and it is expected to reach plateau gas production of about 12.9 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in 2021.  BP eyes India's fuel market, wants gas in GST: CEO Bernard Looney  &amp;quot;We are proud of our partnership with BP that combines our expertise in commissioning gas projects expeditiously, under some of the most challenging geographical and weather conditions. This is a significant milestone in India's energy landscape, for a cleaner and greener gas-based economy. Through our deep-water infrastructure in the Krishna Godavari basin we expect to produce gas and meet the growing clean energy requirements of the nation,&amp;quot; RIL Chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani said.  &amp;quot;This start-up is another example of the possibility of our partnership with Reliance, bringing the best of both companies to help meet India&rsquo;s rapidly expanding energy needs. Growing India&rsquo;s own production of cleaner-burning gas to meet a significant portion of its energy demand, these three new KG D6 projects will support the country&rsquo;s drive to shape and improve its future energy mix,&amp;quot; BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said.  Listen |&nbsp;Will 2021 be a year of recovery for the pharma, auto, and banking sectors?  The next project, the Satellites Cluster, is expected to come onstream in 2021 followed by the MJ project in 2022, the statement said.  Peak gas production from the three fields is expected to be around 30 mmscmd (1 bcf/d) by 2023 which is expected to be about 25 percent of India&rsquo;s domestic production, and will help reduce the country&rsquo;s dependence on imported gas.  These projects will utilise the existing hub infrastructure in KG D6 block.

Zuckerberg and Ambani were speaking at the Facebook Fuel for India 2020 event.  &amp;quot;Before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses,&amp;quot; Ambani said.  In April 2020, Facebook, purchased&nbsp;a 9.9 percent stake in RIL's telecom unit Jio for $5.7 billion (Rs 43,574 crore).  Also read: Facebook buys 9.9% stake in Reliance Jio for Rs 43,574 crore in largest tech FDI  &amp;quot;I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've (Ambani) built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people,&amp;quot; Zuckerberg said on December 15.  Also read: Mukesh Ambani, Mark Zuckerberg discuss India's digital future  The association between the two companies can also play a role in supporting small businesses in India, the Facebook Chief Executive Officer (CEO) said.  &amp;quot;One of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future,&amp;quot; he said.  The RIL chairman also spoke about how Jio and WhatsApp can complement each other's businesses.

      "Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on December 15 interacted with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the internet major's first-ever Fuel for India 2020 event.  The conversation on Day 1 of the two-day Facebook-hosted event revolved around opportunities in India, the way digital can accelerate economic progress, and how small businesses will be a key part of the global recovery going forward.  Read the full transcript of the conversation between Mukesh Ambani and Mark Zuckerberg below:&nbsp;  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I am sorry that we can't do this together in person, but we're excited to host the first-ever Facebook Fuel event in India. India is a very special and important country for us. Millions of people here use our products every day to stay in touch with friends and family. Whether it's a WhatsApp message, or a Facebook post, or photos on Instagram. And millions of small businesses across the country use WhatsApp business and Messenger to reach customers, manage orders, and grow their businesses. And in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally. And speaking of tests, we just announced that we are hosting India&rsquo;s tour of Australia on demand on Facebook Watch. I am not exactly a sports guy myself, but I understand that that's quite a big deal here. And what I do know is that India is home to a lot of incredibly talented people. Now we see that in the folks that we recruit in our offices, both in India and at our headquarters, back in California. But this is more than just about Facebook because what happens in India here is important for the whole world as well. Prime Minister Modi's Digital India Vision, has opened up opportunities for the industry to partner with the government to accelerate growth and development through technology. And India is building local capabilities and tech capacity, to power innovative new business models and provide Indian citizens access to digital and financial inclusion. So, decisions that are made here, shape the global discussion about how technology can drive more economic opportunity and better outcomes for people. And a lot of Indian organizations are leading the way, and using technology to build safer communities and more inclusive financial systems. Whether it's in social commerce, or education or financial services, there is a lot of innovation that happens here, and we are proud to partner with some of the teams that are working on these important challenges. There's a very entrepreneurial culture here, that's quite remarkable. It's a great example of how access to better tools can unlock more opportunity for people, and we see that not just in the tech start-up scene, but millions and millions of small businesses that recognize the value that all these tools can provide. So, at Facebook, we like to say that we are in the business of serving small businesses. And nowhere is this more true than in India. This is especially important because small businesses here will be a key part of the global recovery going forward. And we are focused on making sure we build the best tools for them. So, this is part of a much broader conversation about how we can all make sure that tech delivers for everyone. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to partner with Jio, which has played such a key role in giving hundreds of millions of Indians access to the benefits of the internet, everything that it can provide, and fostering this entrepreneurial culture. And with that, I am really glad to welcome Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, to talk about where things stand in terms of the country's digital transformation, and what we should expect in the years ahead. Mukesh, thank you very much for being here and let's get started.  Mukesh Ambani: Mark, first of all, congratulations to you and your team for organizing this Facebook Fuel for India event. I am sure this event will provide a lot of fuel of ideas to fire India&rsquo;s growth engine as you just described. The most powerful idea that can propel India&rsquo;s growth is that young people can create great enterprises and new businesses. And all the young Indian people see an inspiring young icon in Mark Zuckerberg. They are motivated when they see how in just 14 years, Facebook has become the face of a digitally connected India. So, let me begin by conveying my best wishes to the success of your dreams for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you, I appreciate that. You know, so maybe today we should start with a topic that I know is top of mind for a lot of us, that is COVID-19 and the impact that it has had on all of our lives and communities. So, I am curious from your perspective, how is India doing right now? And when do you expect things are going to return to normal? And I know that Reliance has taken a number of big steps to help the community and help the country, and it's been a big year for you. So I am curious to hear, how did your company adapt to help move forward in the midst of this pandemic?  Mukesh Ambani: The sheer magnitude of COVID-19 pandemic, like everybody else in the world, did startle all of us in India. But then I think it is not in India&rsquo;s DNA to be deterred by a crisis. I firmly believe that a crisis is too precious to be wasted. Every crisis presents an opportunity for new growth, and India has faced the COVID crisis with enormous resilience and resolve. Prime Minister Modi has led India from the front, and while we are not as rich a country as some of our western counterparts, being fiscally prudent, he has taken steps to take care of our vulnerable. We have given free food for right up to December of this year, to over 800 million Indians. 200 million citizens in India are getting direct cash transfer of Rs. 1500 in their bank account - that is the digitally connected India. And now we are ready and pretty much at par with the world, to roll out one of the largest vaccine programs in the first half of 2021, under Prime Minister's leadership. We at Reliance and Reliance Foundation, have also taken steps. As you know, Reliance has over 350,000 employees across the length and breadth of India and we have taken steps to protect over 2 million in our family and the community around them. In Mumbai, we have built a hospital just dedicated to COVID-19. We have Life Sciences as part of our business, so we have tested up early on - we have really ramped up testing, and we believe that testing helped in tracing and isolation, and at least reduced fatalities in our communities to a very low level. We have produced PPEs. We are in the textile business in Reliance, and India did not have&hellip;we used to import all our protective gear from the external world. In a matter of months, we at Reliance, produced a hundred thousand PPE's, and we are now exporters from India and this happened during the COVID time. And most importantly in the early days, when we were little stuck, we at the Reliance Foundation, distributed 55 million, one of the largest meal distribution programs for the vulnerable, in all the states and villages. So, we have played our part. And as far as Jio is concerned, we had our own dedicated team. And I could tell you that, we had never imagined that we would all work from home and the network traffic grew multiple percentage and none of us stepped out. But we could maintain 99% availability, so that Indians could work from home, shop from home, study from home, and remain connected to the rest of the world. You know, Mark, sometimes I wonder that if the pandemic had struck India just four or five years earlier, we would not have been in as good a shape as what we are today, with all the connectivity we have. The credit for that must go to our Prime Minister's Digital India vision, where he motivated the entire industry to roll out broadband in the first five years of his first term. And during the pandemic, India has attracted the largest foreign direct investment in its history. Mark, we have our own example of how Jio and Facebook concluded our partnership right in the middle of lockdown. And let me tell you with utmost sincerity, that we at Reliance and Jio, immensely value our partnership with Facebook. Thank you for your faith in Jio. Thank you, Mark, for your faith in India. I have no hesitation in going on record, that it is your investment that set the ball rolling. Not only for Jio but for the Indian FDI which has been the largest-ever in its history. And our partnership between Jio and Facebook will actually demonstrate that it is great for India, Indians, and small Indian businesses. And I believe Mark, that our actions will speak louder than our words in the coming months and years.  Mark Zuckerberg: Thank you. So, you know, one of the big opportunities that I see with this Facebook and Jio partnership is the role that we can play together in supporting the millions of small businesses in India, especially now with the impact that COVID is having, in accelerating the move of businesses from physical storefronts to digital ones in this digital future. So, I am curious what role do you see technology playing in this post-COVID world, especially as it relates to all of these small businesses. I know you share a passion with me that it is just critical that we serve them.  Mukesh Ambani: Absolutely, Mark. And let me point out a very unique feature about our partnership. Perhaps not many people have understood this. Because, before this partnership I believe that each one of us was mainly a communication platform. Together, we now have become a value creation platform for our customers and small businesses. And I firmly believe that technology, all the digitisation steps that India has taken will democratise wealth and value creation for individuals and small businesses. And let me explain this very simply. WhatsApp has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio has hundreds of millions of subscribers in India. Jio Mart, which is our retail service, has the aspiration of serving tens of millions of small shopkeepers in India, who are the bedrock of employment. So what does this mean? This means Jio brings digital connectivity, WhatsApp now with WhatsApp Pay brings digital interactivity, and the ability to move to close transactions and create value and Jio Mart brings the unmatched online and offline retail opportunity, that gives our small shops which exist in villages and small towns in India, a chance to digitize and be at par with anybody else in the world. To my mind, more wealth creation means more employment and more business. And together with our platforms and the tools that we will provide to small businesses and to individual consumers, I believe will drive India to a 5 trillion economy and will make a much more equal India, with more equal wealth growth at the bottom of the pyramid. You know, Mark, I firmly believe that in the next two decades, India will grow to be among the top three economies in the world. But more importantly, it will become a premier digital society. It will be a modern society with young people driving it, with young businesses driving it. And our per capita income will go from eighteen hundred - two thousand dollars per capita, to five thousand dollars per capita. Our mid-income or the middle class in India which is about 50% of its total number of households, will grow to three to four percent per year. And I think that Facebook, Jio, and a lot of other companies and entrepreneurs in the world, have a golden opportunity to be in India, to be part of this economic and social transformation, that we are witnessing and that will accelerate in the coming decades.  Mark Zuckerberg: I completely agree, and your company has already done so much to help fuel this. Reliance brought about the 4G revolution in India, and I know that 5G now is another big focus for you. But what your company has done here I think, has been truly remarkable in helping to bring hundreds of millions of people onto the internet and bringing opportunity. And I&rsquo;m curious, as you look ahead to the future in India, what other technologies or developments are you excited about now? And where do you see the country in the next five to ten years?  Mukesh Ambani: Well, as I mentioned to you Mark, I really see India accelerating as a premier digital society. I see us integrating both 5G&hellip;and just yesterday, our Prime Minister has said that, he wants every village and every gram panchayat&hellip;India has 680,000 villages, and we have a population of 1.3 billion people, and he wants everybody to be empowered on the information highway with high speed fix broadband, and which is happening. We also think that compute and very low latency compute is real. I think that there is a great opportunity for really bringing education and health care. With the second-generation reforms that were done in the last six months, we have unique opportunities and as Jio we are connecting all the 1.9 million schools in India and the 58 000 colleges. At any point in time, we will have in the coming decades, about 200 million children or young adults, between the age of 3 and 18 in our education system. I think that in a span of 10 years, we can set for ourselves an objective really to reskill India and the talent that you talked about, can improve 10x. Today, you're just seeing the creamy layer, but that's what technology can do to really make a better India and a better world. The same thing we can do in health and all the emerging technology and integrations, where we can make sure that we deliver services, and we deliver good proactive health. We've learned that and I think we're going to use technology. We are working very closely with all the authorities to make sure that we provide the technology tools and backbone for even vaccination in the coming quarters using technology. So, I think health, education&hellip;.we've already&hellip; and I think that what India has done is in a sense, we have democratized value creation with the drive of our Prime Minister. And you can see it in payments, you will see it in terms of making sure that technology is easily available and we made it affordable, so that millions of millions of people, even at this lower per capita basis can use this in a large market. And with that finally, I really see the enterprise and the enthusiasm of young Indians, their aspirations, and their confidence that is really driving India. And that is why I think that the next two decades are going to be historic in terms of the social and economic transformation.  Mark Zuckerberg: That makes sense. You, of course, already talked about commerce and driving small businesses and entrepreneurship. It always blows me away that India has more than 60 million small businesses, and millions of people around the country rely on them for jobs and that's a big part of what I hope that our partnership can serve here. We support more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users globally every month already. And more than 15 million of these are in India. So you know with communities around the world now in lockdown there are a lot of these entrepreneurs who need digital tools that they can rely on to find and communicate with customers and grow their businesses. And now this is just something that I think that our partnership can really help with. And of course, beyond the impact on small businesses.I just think that this year has reminded us of how essential technology can be as a tool for people, to just connect with each other. Whether it's using the networks that your companies have established, or the tools that we've built to be able to have that human connection, and find important information. And as you said, I can't imagine going through the pandemic 10 years ago, two decades, when the internet was still nascent. It should have been a completely different experience. And technology, of course, is allowing us to make sure we can get accurate information out to people that has implications in health, like you're talking about, in education and helping serve people better. And I think it shows a lot of the promise for what's ahead and I think we've certainly fared better now, than we would have if the pandemic had hit us before.  Mukesh Ambani: I couldn't agree more, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: You know, going back to Reliance, one of the great business stories in history, your father founded Reliance Industries and he has this incredible legacy here in India. And now I&rsquo;ve read that, he once held up a postcard in his office and said, if every Indian could speak with each other at the cost of this postcard, where will India be? And now your father clearly had a vision for where things were heading in the country, and because today Indians can communicate with one another for less than the cost of a postcard, and that's what we've tried to do with messaging&hellip;and hopefully we can do that together with payments and make it so people can use India's new UPI system, which I think is just great. It's a tremendous public good that the government has put out there. But I am curious, before we get into UPI and more on that, what's the most important thing that you learned from your father and his legacy, that has helped you build these amazing businesses and get to where they are today?  Mukesh Ambani: So Mark, thank you for those kind words on my father. Just so that when he motivated us in 2000, in terms of saying, can you make voice at the cost of a postcard? In 2020, we're very proud that Jio has pioneered free voice. So, all the 400 million people are a tribute to his vision. They are on our network and have a free voice. And as you said, my father was a son of a school teacher. He came to Mumbai with just a thousand rupees in 1960 and established Reliance with a belief that I will invest in businesses of the future, and I will invest in talent. And, for all the young people at Reliance and across India, I repeat my learnings in terms of building Reliance, three basic tenets really. One is, for entrepreneurs, it's important to have courage and self-belief. There can be no better person to demonstrate that in the last couple of decades than you, Mark. So you know, all of us believe that we have to believe in ourselves. And all of us know as entrepreneurs that we don't succeed at the first attempt, and self-belief comes to you when you fail. And self-belief increases your confidence when you succeed. So, courage and self-belief is something that I always tell entrepreneurs, remember that it's important. The second piece that he started and he's instilled into all of us is that, while you succeed, it's important to always have empathy and creativity in everything that you do. And by empathy, I mean, put yourself in the other's shoe, and make sure that how you make them feel is how you would want to feel. At Reliance, we do that at many levels now - we care for our employees, our investors, society, environment, and above all national interests of India. You know, within creativity&hellip;.and I always give this example in terms of saying that, when Reliance needed to grow, capital markets were not there. It was the 1980s, and my father came up by saying, I will actually share shares of Reliance, which was never done in the private sector. In the 80s, the first AGM of Reliance was in a football ground, and we had 60,000 shareholders. You and I both do annual general meetings. And his AGM in the 1980s for Reliance was in a football ground and he said, my purpose is really to win investor&rsquo;s confidence. Since then, creativity and empathy are critical as you go along. And the final thing that I have learned from my father, is really the importance of relationship, trust, and loyalty. The whole of Reliance right now, with hundreds of thousands of people, is one big family. We're not related by birth, but we are really woven together by passion, purpose, and conviction. We have faith in one another. We are loyal to one another, to this large Reliance family. For us, it's always one for all, and all for one. And I hope that a lot of people around the world can relate to this. That's what we believe at Reliance and for all of us at Reliance, he will still be the founder, if we follow his vision in terms of investing in businesses of the future. Mark, now that brings me to questions for you. Mark, what made you believe in India and the Jio story? As I said, you started this FDI avalanche in India, and the world recognized when Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, in the middle of lockdown said, I am going to bet on India and I&rsquo;m going to make even in this uncertain times, one of the largest foreign direct investments in India. What do you think of the digital network that you are clearly&hellip;.I call you the architect of the digital network of the world. While I have built some connectivity and broadband connectivity in India, you've done that for the world. Please share with us your experience as the digital architect of the world, how your global Facebook has helped people in this crisis, and your perspective of the crisis, and where you see the world today, and where it is going after you just explain to us what you&rsquo;ve done in India?  Mark Zuckerberg: Your words are incredibly generous. And we started this to help give people a tool to stay connected with their friends, and then expand to friends and family and communities, and a lot of this just ends up being a universal human phenomenon. No matter what country you're in, you know everyone cares about their friends and family, and their communities, and wants to stay connected. And what we've seen is that, India is actually home to the largest communities in the world, across Facebook and WhatsApp and getting there on Instagram, as well. So, we see the vitality and the entrepreneurship, and the creativity of businesses, and how much people want to connect, and you see a tremendous number of people coming online, a lot of that&hellip;thanks to your investments, and the work that you've done to enable hundreds of millions of people to come online here. And I just see a very promising future in India. We talked briefly about how there's a big trend of financial inclusion ahead, and how the ease of payments is going to be such a big deal for commerce, and giving people self-reliance and control of their own destiny, and a lot of that. We just launched WhatsApp payments in India last month - now you can send money to your friends and family through WhatsApp, as easily as sending a message. That was possible because of the UPI system that has been built in India. Unified Payments Interface, makes it easy for anyone to instantly accept payments across different apps. I think we're working with 140 banks or it's supported by 140 banks. India is the first country in the world to do anything like this. So, we're grateful to be able to support this kind of innovation and to help to work, to create more prosperity, and help achieve a more Digital India. And frankly, I think that a lot of other places around the world are going to be better off when they follow some of this lead that India has set, in creating public goods like this. So there's really a tremendous amount to be inspired by, with what is going on in India now. And we're just grateful to be able to serve our community here, and help people stay connected with the people they care about but also, create economic opportunity as well.  Mukesh Ambani: Thanks Mark, as you said, we are looking forward to your involvement and innovation in India, creating benefit for hundreds of millions of people and then taking this innovation to the rest of the world. I hope that the rest of the world learns from Indian policy, and what Facebook is able to achieve in India. And we as Indians will be very proud, if Facebook says we did it first in India, and then took it to 100 countries. And I look forward to working with you on that. Mark, all of us would love to know your views on how the world is changing, and what you and Facebook are thinking about it, and what you see the future as. Just give us your perspective, Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg: I think that there are a number of very important trends, but maybe I'll just talk about two. So, one is that, I think technology is giving individuals&rsquo; power and opportunities that were previously only held by large organizations. So, we've spent a lot of time today talking about small businesses, but one of the things that I think is so powerful about the internet is it makes it so that individual entrepreneurs and small businesses can now have access to the same kind of tools for reaching new customers and doing sophisticated analytics and communication that previously only bigger companies would have been able to build up the capacity to do that. And individuals can now share their ideas online, and get access to information in ways that previously only wealthier people or larger organizations would have had the capacity to share their ideas, or get access to information at that kind of scale. And overall, I think that just makes people's lives better. It's incredibly empowering and it's incredibly democratizing. India being the world's largest democracy, I think it really makes sense to lead there, because just empowering individuals, which I know is something that you believe deeply in as well, is just going to be a huge part of what will hopefully create a lot of prosperity, as you mentioned in the decades ahead. The other thing that I&rsquo;m excited about is more of a technological vision for the future. There are a lot of interesting technologies, but one trend that I focus a lot on is that as people we're always looking to connect with other people and share our experiences in the richest way that we can. So, if you look back to the beginning of the internet, most of the internet was text. We would text each other, chat, share our experiences but then connections got better. And then we got to photos being the primary way that we shared. And you know the old saying, a picture is worth a thousand words. Now, a lot of sharing is through photos and we're now on the next step with 4G and coming 5G networks - video is really becoming the primary way that people share. Anyone can largely capture something on their phones and can share it or stream it, and increasingly, people are able to consume that. And video is just a lot richer of a medium than photos even can be. When my daughters took her first steps, I wanted to capture a video of that and share it, not just a photo. But I don't think video is the end of the line. So, a lot of what I am focused on is helping to create virtual reality and augmented reality. So that way we can share not only a video of an experience, but you can use virtual reality to go into an experience and feel like you're right there. You can have holograms of digital objects that can kind of be as realistic as the physical objects that are there. Maybe you know, in five or ten years, when we're having this conversation, just a hologram version of me will be sitting on the couch next to you, instead of having to do this over a screen. And it'll feel a lot more realistic. So, I just think that's going to be incredibly powerful. And the power of virtual and augmented reality is they deliver the sense of a presence. You feel like you're right there with another person, which really will be the ultimate in human connection, and it will give people the opportunity to work and to connect, no matter where they want to be. So that's something that we're very focused on and invested in. And I&rsquo;m just very excited for the future. And on that note, let me just wrap up and just say again how grateful I am for everything that you and your companies do, and for the partnership. I do think that in so many ways, not just Jio and the technology platforms, but the other businesses that you've built, you've had such a positive impact on improving the quality of lives for hundreds of millions of Indians. A big part of why I was excited to partner with you is, there are not many people around the world who've just gone industry after industry and revolutionized them and improved them, and continue to do it, and have that hunger to improve the lives of so many people. So, I just have a deep admiration for that. And I am really looking forward to working together over the coming years and decades to make sure we can serve the people in India as well as possible. And hopefully, a lot of those advances will be expanded outside of India as well, to help people around the world. But I am incredibly grateful for your partnership on this. Thank you for joining me for this inaugural Facebook Fuel event today.  Mukesh Ambani: Thank you very much, Mark. And thank you for sharing your awesome vision of the future. You started this with saying that on Facebook, you would see the India - Australia cricket match, I look forward to a day when Facebook will take me with everything that you explained on virtual reality, where I will be sitting in Mumbai and be in a stadium in Australia. And I&rsquo;m sure that day, with your digital architecture and leadership, is not far away. Thank you so very much for having me.

      "Aiming to boost the income of local artisans under 'Vocal for Local' mission, Reliance Retail Ltd showcased more than 40,000 artisan-crafted products from over 50 GI clusters to its customers this festive season.  The firm said under its three-year old flagship initiatives - &ldquo;Indie by AJIO&rdquo; and &ldquo;Swadesh&rdquo;, it now engages with more than 30,000 craftsmen, representing over 600 art forms across a wide spectrum of clothing, textiles, handicrafts, and handmade natural goods.  Reliance Retail completes Rs 47,265 crore fundraise from 10.09% stake sale  &amp;quot;We are delighted that our development efforts over the last few years are now bearing strong results both in our ability to engage with an increasing number of craftsmen as well as our ability to co-create and co-curate products that are being increasingly accepted by today&rsquo;s consumers,&amp;quot; Reliance Fashion &amp;amp;amp; Lifestyle President Akhilesh Prasad said.  Reliance Retail also said its success in bringing such a huge repertoire of traditional handcrafted products to its modern retail formats is also an indication of the existence of demand for such products, as long as consumers&rsquo; expectations of quality, style, and convenience of modern retail buying can be met.  The fashion and lifestyle arm of Reliance said its 'Indie range' (Indie by AJIO) is sourced from over 50 GI crafts clusters from across Indian states - including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.  With this geographical indication tag, natural produce, handicrafts, or manufactured goods are identified native to a territory, region, or locality for their unique characteristics.  &amp;quot;The diversity of sourcing from across the length and breadth of India has resulted not only in the creation of a stunning portfolio that is every handcraft connoisseur&rsquo;s dream, but also in the direct employment for over 30,000 skilled artisans across the country. We will continue to grow this segment with time,&amp;quot; Akhilesh Prasad said.  Reliance Retail's other brand 'Swadesh' has an MoU with the Ministry of Textiles which enables the sourcing of 100 percent authentically crafted products, directly from artisan communities. This brand is available across multiple formats including AJIO and Trends, while it also offers over 400 types of handmade textiles, handicrafts, and agricultural products that are listed with GI tags.  Reliance Retail Ltd is a subsidiary of Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), which is a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd and is the holding company of all the retail companies under the RIL Group.  RRVL reported a consolidated turnover of Rs 1,62,936 crore ($21.7 billion) and net profit of Rs 5,448 crore ($ 726.4 million) for the year ended March 31, 2020.

      "RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani on November 21 addressed the 8th Convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU). Here's what he said\n",
      "Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani on November 21 spoke at&nbsp;the 8th Convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU).  Here's what Ambani said during the virtual address:  Honourable Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupaniji, my fellow members of the Board, faculty, teachers, staff, students, parents, and my dear friends,  A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. I wish all of you good health and safety. I hope that you are all taking necessary precautions to keep yourself and your dear ones safe and protected.  India has entered a crucial phase in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot afford to let our guards down at this juncture.  We are extremely privileged to have the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Sh Narendrabhai Modi, as the chief guest for today&rsquo;s event. His passionate and dynamic leadership has made the world sit up and take notice of the emergence of a New India.  His confidence and conviction have inspired and galvanised the entire nation.  I am sure that the bold reforms introduced under his leadership will pave the way for India&rsquo;s swift recovery and rapid economic progress in the years to come.  Friends, all of us know that PDPU itself is a product of Honourable Prime Minister Narendrabhai's &amp;quot;Atmanirbhar&amp;quot; vision.  It is a vision he cherished even when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat...to make India self-reliant in the areas of Energy, Energy Education, Research and Innovation.  PDPU is only fourteen years old. Yet, it already ranks among the Top-25 in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements.  In terms of diversity, we attract international students from across the world. We have 284 international students from 39 countries.  And from a total of 132 students in the first convocation in 2009, we have 2,608 students, including 46 PhDs, graduating today.  From National Rankings, I am sure PDPU will soon earn a place in global rankings.  My dear teachers, PDPU has world-class physical infrastructure. But what gives me far greater joy is that PDPU has world-class faculty as well. Your dedication and commitment to excellence has been exemplary.  In the best practice of India's Guru Parampara, you have always gone beyond the call of duty. You have been friends, guides and mentors to your students. Let's take a moment to appreciate the leadership, faculty and all the staff of PDPU.  Friends, today I have a special reason to applaud PDPU. The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on the academic lives and careers of students across the world.  Precious hours of academic engagement, debate and research have been lost in lockdowns. Yet, our very own PDPU did exceptionally well even in these challenging times.  The flame of teaching and learning at PDPU shone brightest even during the darkest days of the pandemic. Our faculty continued to present award-winning research papers in national and international conferences. Our students continued to enjoy co-curricular and extra-curricular activities held digitally.  These facts make me proud of our university. But my heart swelled with greater pride when I learnt that PDPU also contributed to the nation's fight against COVID-19. Our teachers and students designed several medical equipment, including an ICU ventilator.  I salute the leadership of PDPU for combining Jnana with Seva. This combination is the greatest badge of honour for any educational institution.  Dear members of the PDPU Community, our accomplishments so far have been a source of joy.  However, we have to prepare ourselves to scale still higher summits of success.  The future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes. And these changes are impacting the future of humanity &mdash; indeed, the very future of our planet.  The most important question we face is this:  Can we produce the growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment?...Without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations? We must be prepared to answer this question with a CONFIDENT &amp;quot;YES&amp;quot;!  By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India&rsquo;s own per-capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today.  Therefore, India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: To become an economic superpower. To become a green and clean energy superpower.  To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation.  As a person from the energy business, I can assure the students and faculty of PDPU that you are entering an exciting future.  What makes it even more exciting is the synergy between the Energy Revolution and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If we master this synergy, we will surely be able to make India one of the most prosperous nations in the world. An India that guarantees prosperity and wellbeing for all 1.3 billion Indians.  Honourable Chief Minister Shri Rupani ji, Gujarat is a trailblazer state. It has always shown the pioneer spirit. Today the entire world acknowledges that NEW GUJARAT has paved the path for NEW INDIA. The visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji that Gujarat received is now available to the nation.  I must compliment you and your team for making Vibrant Gujarat even more vibrant under the guidance of Shri Modi ji and Shri Amit Shah ji.  Here is our solemn assurance to you today. PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhancing the reputation of Gujarat and India in energy education and research.  My dear Young Graduates, I see in you, 2,608 future builders of a strong, proud and vibrant India. My heartiest congratulations to you on your success. May all your dreams come true as you embark on a new journey in your life.  However, always remember an important life lesson. Learning is a constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure. A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, here is my message to you, and I am only repeating Mahatma Gandhi's wise words: &amp;quot;Learn for life, Learn through life, and Learn throughout life&amp;quot;.  I have another message for you. When you step out of this beautiful campus, you will no doubt carry wonderful memories with you.  But perhaps you will also carry some concern, some uncertainty, some anxiety about the future.  This is only natural. The COVID situation will likely accentuate your thoughts and feelings.  Therefore, I would like to tell you with great emphasis today...venture out with supreme hope and confidence. The future is very bright for India, for you, and for all Indians.  This, our ancient nation, has faced many adversities in the past. And has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people, Indian culture.  In the post-COVID era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies in the world.  Growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see many amongst you as the creators of successful startups.  The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dreams. With passion, purpose and persistent effort, your dreams will indeed come true.  We, at PDPU, take pride in now calling you our alumni &ndash; our ambassadors. Make all of us at PDPU proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud.  Once again, my hearty congratulations to the Class of 2019 and 2020. Good luck and God bless.  Thank you.

The mega transaction cements the position of Reliance Retail as the undisputed leader in the organised retail segment and adds muscle to its ongoing battle with Amazon for the Indian e-commerce market.  Reliance Retail-Future Group deal: RIL unit adds Future Group&rsquo;s retail business to shopping cart for Rs 24,713 crore.&nbsp;  The Future Group houses leading retail formats, including supermarket chain Big Bazaar, upmarket food stores Foodhall, and bargain clothing chain Brand Factory. The acquisition is being done as part of a scheme in which Future Group is merging certain companies carrying on the aforesaid businesses into Future Enterprises Ltd (FEL).  The announcement comes as a setback to Amazon.com which has claimed that Future Group violated its agreement with the US e-commerce giant by entering into the deal with RIL.  Amazon had moved the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October and won an interim stay on the deal. The SIAC passed the interim order asking Future Group to hold its plans of selling its retail business to RIL on October 25.&nbsp;  Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into FRL after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owned a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail.  Along with this, Amazon even wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI seeking a stay on the deal.  Later, Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) on November 7 moved the Delhi High Court against Amazon.com for interfering in its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL) by misusing the arbitration order passed by SIAC.

      "BP eyes India's fuel market, wants gas in GST: CEO Bernard Looney\n",
      "On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, Looney said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. \n",
      "Labelling India as an extraordinary country growing at an incredible scale, energy supermajor BP Plc on&nbsp;October 26 said it is looking to expand its presence in the nation in fuel retailing and mobility solutions, but wanted natural gas to be included in the GST regime. Speaking at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, BP Group chief executive Bernard Looney said his firm in partnership with Reliance Industries Ltd will in the next 4-5 years set up 5,500 retail sites that will not just sell petrol and diesel but also offer mobility solutions like EV charging facility.  &amp;quot;India is an extraordinary country with an extraordinary history, an extraordinary group of people, and with extraordinary ambition,&amp;quot; he said, adding the country has a growing population, and an ambitious agenda to cut emissions. This, he said, was &amp;quot;very, very compelling&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;Why is India important, because it is India,&amp;quot; he said, adding energy mix in the country could fall from 50 percent coal to 40 percent, while gas and renewables will grow. Looney said India will be the fastest-growing fuel and lubricant market in the next 20 years and his group's venture with Reliance will grow the network of petrol pumps to 5,500 in the next 4-5 years from the current 1,400.  As many as 80,000 jobs will be created in the building of the network, he said, adding the venture will offer mobility solutions under the Jio-BP brand. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports. These have been taken over by the RIL-BP joint venture and will be grown in the future. While petrol pumps will be expanded to 5,500, aviation refuelling facilities will grow to 45. RIL, currently, has about 1,400 operating petrol pumps and some 31-odd aviation fuel stations at airports.  RIL holds 51 percent in the new joint venture company, while BP has the remaining 49 percent. BP paid about Rs 7,000 crore to acquire the 49 percent stake. This is the third joint venture between Reliance and BP since 2011.  BP had in 2011 bought a 30 percent stake in 21 oil and gas exploration and production blocks of Reliance for $7.2 billion. At that time, another 50:50 joint venture, India Gas Solutions, was set up for sourcing and marketing gas in India. RIL-BP is investing $5 billion in developing the next set of discoveries in the KG Basin D6 block.  &amp;quot;Our production with Reliance will account for 15 percent of India gas production,&amp;quot; he said. Looney said while the company feels the ease of doing business on the ground, India is a complex market.  GST was a welcome federal initiative to ease trade and it will be good if natural gas is included in that. When Goods and Services Tax (GST), which amalgamated 17 different central and state levies like excise duty and VAT, was implemented in July 2017, five products &ndash; petrol, diesel, crude oil, aviation turbine fuel, and natural gas, were kept out of its purview for the time being.  This meant that gas users could not set off tax paid on inputs against those on the final product and tax on tax continued, disincentivising the use of the fuel. He said BP has a &amp;quot;deep, trusting relationship&amp;quot; with Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.  On the impact of COVID-19 on oil demand, he said it was too early to say what the true impact was but there would be some impact in the medium to long term. But communities around the world are demanding more affordable, reliable, and clean energy and BP was committed to providing solutions for the same, he said.  Speaking at the same event, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said India is one of the largest markets in the world for energy, but its per capita consumption is just 30 percent of the world average, offering huge potential. &amp;quot;We want to be an important part of India,&amp;quot; he said, adding the French group is investing in setting up LNG import terminal, city gas expansion, and renewable energy projects in the country.

      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said the Centre would come out with fresh growth and budgetary estimates for the COVID-19 pandemic-hit 2020-21.\n",
      "  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on October 19 that the government is open to another round of stimulus measures and that the Centre will come out with fresh growth and budgetary estimates for the COVID-19 pandemic-hit 2020-21.  &amp;quot;I am not closed to the option of further stimulus package. Every time we have announced one, it has been after much deliberation and aimed at specific sections. If there is a need, further stimulus is an option I am open to,&rdquo;&nbsp;Sitharaman said at the launch of 15th&nbsp;Finance Commission Chairman NK Singh&rsquo;s autobiography.  &ldquo;We have only now started doing some sort of assessment (of the economy and budget numbers). We have had inputs now which are very different from July. Sometime, we will have to come out with a statement, whether I do it in public or Parliament is what we have to decide,&rdquo; she said.  The Finance Ministry has begun the exercise of preparing the 2021-22 Union Budget. The first part of the process is coming up with revised estimates for the current fiscal year, in this case FY21. It remains to be seen if the finance ministry would present fresh GDP numbers for the current year before the Union Budget for next year.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has projected a contraction of 9.5 percent in real GDP for FY21, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast a contraction of 10.3 percent.  Speaking at the launch, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani said India was perfectly placed to embrace cleaner sources of energy over the coming decades. Listing transformation of energy as one of his aims, he said: &ldquo;India is in the right space to move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the next few decades.&rdquo;  Ambani also said transformation of India into a digital society and transformation of the education system were some of the initiatives he was planning to undertake.
